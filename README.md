# queerly-optimistic-uploader

A small tool to help upload specific data to a certain api, in a specific format
using Rust, with a simple gui made with Slint.

You input an endpoint, you use the file dialog to pick a proper file, you upload.
Simple enough.

Made over a weekend so could probably use more polish.
